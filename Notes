Current Branch:
moveEntityYesSnap

Objective:
- Create graphing program
- Add entities with data
- Add relationship lines with data
- Place entities in positions that obey rules applied
- Freely move around entities

General Notes:
- Moving entities (using snap. Branch: moveEntityYesSnap)
When we click on the canvas we check if the mouse is on an entity. 
We make a list of clicked entities and find the highest priority one.
We set the highest prirority clicked entity to a reference (entityBeingMoved).
We enable entityMoving mode to be true.
The entityBeingMoved will have it's x and y updated to the mouseX and mouseY while entityBeingMode is true and will be set false once there is another click. 

Issues:
- A mouse click is not always registered by processing.

Achieved:
- Collision detection
---
- Create Entity Button
---
- Edit and create entity mode
- Button class
---
- Display what mode we are on (top-right)
---
- Move entities (Snap entity to center)
---

Currently:


Features to work on:
- Ability to move entities based on priority
- Having a box for data
- Showing and hiding data and updating the entity dimensions based on the data box being shown.
- Moving the initial position of an entity if spawned onto an entity
